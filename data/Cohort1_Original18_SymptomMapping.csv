No weakness in the arms, legs, or face. No facial twitching. She has noticed some issues with ""stuttering"" when talking as well as memory issues (not everyday), and also reports having ?auditory episodes that she has previously reported to providers. In the last week she noticed in the R side of her face and her cheek (1.5 weeks ago) she was having paresthesias. She noticed that the symptoms in the face have stopped but then she noticed that she can have it on the left and the right sides more recently. She also has had right ear pain lasting 30-60 seconds but self-resolves. She has not noticed any changes in her hearing. In her left ear she can get ringing/episodes of difficulty hearing. She has not had any issues with her balance. She has had regular headaches off/on since May, and nausea/vomiting in June. She has not had vomiting for a few months. She has been referred to neurology as well, and spoke with them today with follow up appointment in December. I conveyed that it would be difficult to relate this constellation of symptoms to the right petrous apex lesion, previously reported as a 9mm hemangioma. We would typically expect either changes in ipsilateral facial function or hearing to relate to a sudden change in the mass, which does not appear definite. The presence of waxing/waning symptoms also involving the extremities would also seem unusual given the localized nature of the petrous apex lesion. I noted that it would not be unreasonable to check another MRI to see if the mass has changed, as the MRI may also offer additional insight into whether her symptoms represent a ""post-COVID"" neurologic picture, which she has been advised of. She will let us know once the MRI has been completed. AS OF 11/17/20: other previously listed issues + severe dyspnea during exercise, then feels nauseated, fatigued for rest of day and longer after exercise; AS OF 11/25/20: attached a picture of the blood from one time last night. It’s been getting heavier and happening later into the morning last few weeks. I’ve developed a dull headache like I had back in April and nothing seems to help, then today I woke up with excruciating headache, congested, cough, feeling just awful. Took Tylenol. Helped a bit. Then the nausea started and has been all day. I finally just gave in and took a zofran (I was trying not to bc I was worried that’s what was causing the constipation though now I have nonstop diarrhea again..) Feeling a bit better now. If I feel like this again tomo I may go get a rapid test just in case. Other than that my most “debilitating” symptom at this point last few weeks are the awful joint and muscle pains in my elbows, one wrist, knees and my arms and lower back. CAN FILL OUT FOLLOWING MONTHS IF REQUESTED BUT FOR NOW SKIP TO RECENT NOTES. AS OF 7/14/21: female with post Covid syndrome, PVCs and intermittent tachycardia who presents in routine follow-up. She recently had intermittent symptoms of tachycardia for which I prescribed preventives 14-day monitor.  She received the monitor, however, she has not had any further tachycardia or PVCs.  Her most recent episode may have been triggered by Advair use which she has since discontinued.  At times she has noted that her heart rate would drop around from 82 150, and as high as 175. Currently, she states ""I feel pretty good.""  She still has fatigue and get significantly tired at the middle/end of her workday but she is still able to work. She gets occasional intermittent tingling of extremities. Still gets SOB and uses albuterol when she has sx. Using treadmill - had been training but unable to exceed 13 min mile, which is very different from her usual, previously she was able to train and improve her performance and she is no longer able to do that. Was evaluated who thought her symptoms were consistent with myalgic encephalomyelitis/chronic fatigue syndrome (ME/CFS). He suggested autonomic testing, she is waiting to have that scheduled.  He also suggested she return to Dr. Song, ENT regarding repeat endoscopy.",1,1,1,0,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,0,1,0,0,0,0,0
