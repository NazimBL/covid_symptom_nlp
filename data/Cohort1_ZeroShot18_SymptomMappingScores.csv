635870,s086_Female_108_3_6M_PASC,"OVERALL IMPRESSION: pt appears to have long COVID/post-COVID syndrome, mostly presenting in the form of neurological issues; AS OF 8/6/20: Pt with s/s of COVID-19 (GI symptoms with nausea and abdominal cramping and she had a low grade temp 99) starting on April 5th. She was prescribed an inhaler for her shortness of breath but did not require supplemental oxygen. She was seen in the NWH ER on 4/16, and 5/12 for shortness of breath with findings consistent with COVID pneumonia on 4/16 and with subsequently negative chest x-ray, cardiac testing and COVID test on 5/12. She has also reported ocular migraines without headaches and other dull headaches throughout her course. Pt has had normal echo and CT chest on 5/29 as well as a normal holter monitor study. She has also had normal PFTs, and bronchoscopy. She has recently started a nebulizer with minimal effect. Pt also endorses a room spinning dizziness (1-2 minutes) that has been happening intermittently (without any specific trigger) over the past two months. She is scheduled for a brain MRI on Wednesday 8/12. Biggest two symptoms are HR increasing from 60 at rest to 120-180 and shortness of breath with a need to yawn to take a deep breath. Pt also reports body aches and pains (even in fingers and forearms). works from home in 2 hour chunks, ~3 hours at a time ~5 days/week. Pt enjoys gardening outdoors and was able to plant for an hour or two on a few occasions. Able to read as well. AS OF 10/14/20: Pt has not been seen since 9/23 due to increase in symptoms and then work conflict last week. She reports that she has been intermittently doing fast walking and then some days doing run walks. Pt reported onset of intense shin pain that lasted for 2 days. On Saturday she completed her run walk progression and then in the evening she had chest pain and pressure with some shortness of breath. She has continued to have some intermittent shortness of breath and chest pain but has been able to do 30-40 minutes walk at a fast pace without change in symptoms. She tried a run/walk today without difficulty. Pt reports an overall increase in endurance for the day is improved with less days where she needs to lay down and rest; AS OF 10/21/20: CPET with ongoing symptoms of dyspnea on exertion, hemoptysis. She continues to have a cough, runny nose, SOB. She intermittently has hemoptysis throughout the night (4-6 times and once in AM). She continues to have neuropathies in feet/hand. She started physical therapy 2 months ago and she can now walk up to 20 minutes. She has significant fatigue/exhaustion after some episodes of exercise. She has some palpitations but never gets dizzy or lightheaded. Before COVID she ran the marathon. She has a prior history of SVT (9 years ago), but hasn't recurred since then. AS OF 10/25/20: Possibly post COVID persistent neuropathy symptoms given multiple sites that are involved.  Her brain MRI 8/2020 showed: There is a 9 x 7 x 8 mm nodular enhancing lesion in the right petrous apex, which extends into the anterior aspect of the right internal auditory canal and cerebellopontine angle cistern. The size of the lesion and enhancement is stable compared to the 8/21/2019 and 5/30/2018 MRIs, and is minimally increased in size since the 8/29/2017 MRI. The lesion encroaches on the right facial nerve within the internal auditory canal, similar to prior without clear mass-effect. If sx persist, will repeat brain MRI; AS OF 10/28/20: memory issues; says started suddenly w/in ""last month or 2""; ""blacking out"" complete conversations w/ family, clients; writing emails and having no memory of writing them; issues comprehending things she should understand; what she forgets is random, not everything; also has random bouts of severe breathing difficulty/dyspnea, though O2 is not low; AS OF 11/4/20: She also notes intermittent neurological symptoms. She has had a few episodes of visual hallucinations-she thought she saw a man in the yard that was not there. She also thought she saw a dog flying. She also has noted some auditory hallucinations-thought there were people outside of her yard. She also reports short term memory loss. She has had episodes where she feels like she cant remember work related items or emails she has sent. Also with some intermittent tingling in the thumbs and fingers-this has essentially resolved. She also has had a few episodes of blue lines in her hands. AS OF 11/9/20: She notes that she has been having symptoms -- COVID back in April. She notes that she has been having tingling down her both legs (knees down), as well as right leg more recently, and in her arm (both arms and fingers, but hasn't experienced in the past 1-2 months). No weakness in the arms, legs, or face. No facial twitching. She has noticed some issues with ""stuttering"" when talking as well as memory issues (not everyday), and also reports having ?auditory episodes that she has previously reported to providers. In the last week she noticed in the R side of her face and her cheek (1.5 weeks ago) she was having paresthesias. She noticed that the symptoms in the face have stopped but then she noticed that she can have it on the left and the right sides more recently. She also has had right ear pain lasting 30-60 seconds but self-resolves. She has not noticed any changes in her hearing. In her left ear she can get ringing/episodes of difficulty hearing. She has not had any issues with her balance. She has had regular headaches off/on since May, and nausea/vomiting in June. She has not had vomiting for a few months. She has been referred to neurology as well, and spoke with them today with follow up appointment in December. I conveyed that it would be difficult to relate this constellation of symptoms to the right petrous apex lesion, previously reported as a 9mm hemangioma. We would typically expect either changes in ipsilateral facial function or hearing to relate to a sudden change in the mass, which does not appear definite. The presence of waxing/waning symptoms also involving the extremities would also seem unusual given the localized nature of the petrous apex lesion. I noted that it would not be unreasonable to check another MRI to see if the mass has changed, as the MRI may also offer additional insight into whether her symptoms represent a ""post-COVID"" neurologic picture, which she has been advised of. She will let us know once the MRI has been completed. AS OF 11/17/20: other previously listed issues + severe dyspnea during exercise, then feels nauseated, fatigued for rest of day and longer after exercise; AS OF 11/25/20: attached a picture of the blood from one time last night. It’s been getting heavier and happening later into the morning last few weeks. I’ve developed a dull headache like I had back in April and nothing seems to help, then today I woke up with excruciating headache, congested, cough, feeling just awful. Took Tylenol. Helped a bit. Then the nausea started and has been all day. I finally just gave in and took a zofran (I was trying not to bc I was worried that’s what was causing the constipation though now I have nonstop diarrhea again..) Feeling a bit better now. If I feel like this again tomo I may go get a rapid test just in case. Other than that my most “debilitating” symptom at this point last few weeks are the awful joint and muscle pains in my elbows, one wrist, knees and my arms and lower back. CAN FILL OUT FOLLOWING MONTHS IF REQUESTED BUT FOR NOW SKIP TO RECENT NOTES. AS OF 7/14/21: female with post Covid syndrome, PVCs and intermittent tachycardia who presents in routine follow-up. She recently had intermittent symptoms of tachycardia for which I prescribed preventives 14-day monitor.  She received the monitor, however, she has not had any further tachycardia or PVCs.  Her most recent episode may have been triggered by Advair use which she has since discontinued.  At times she has noted that her heart rate would drop around from 82 150, and as high as 175. Currently, she states ""I feel pretty good.""  She still has fatigue and get significantly tired at the middle/end of her workday but she is still able to work. She gets occasional intermittent tingling of extremities. Still gets SOB and uses albuterol when she has sx. Using treadmill - had been training but unable to exceed 13 min mile, which is very different from her usual, previously she was able to train and improve her performance and she is no longer able to do that. Was evaluated who thought her symptoms were consistent with myalgic encephalomyelitis/chronic fatigue syndrome (ME/CFS). He suggested autonomic testing, she is waiting to have that scheduled.
